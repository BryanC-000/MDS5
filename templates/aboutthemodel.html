                            Model 1: InceptionResNetV2 (Our Proposed Model) <br> </h1>
                        <p>
                            InceptionResNetV2 is a convolutional neural network that is trained on more than a million
                            images
                            from the ImageNet database. The network is 164 layers deep and can classify images into 1000
                            object
                            categories, such as keyboard, mouse, pencil, and many animals. This model that is pre-trained on
                            these object images
                            has been trained with breast cancer histology images in this architecture such that it will be
                            able to classify
                            breast cancer histology images.

                        <p>
                            The InceptionV3 model is a superior version of the basic mconvolutional neural network Inception
                            V1 which
                            was introduced as GoogLeNet in 2014. It is also pre-trained on the ImageNet database and is 48
                            layers deep.
                            This pre-trained model has been trained with breast cancer histology
                            images in this architecture such that it will be able to classify breast cancer histology
                            images.

                        <p>
                            A benign tumor is an abnormal but noncancerous collection of cells.
                            If you feel a lump in your breast, your first thought may be that you have breast cancer.
                            Fortunately, a majority of breast lumps are benign, meaning they're not cancerous.
                            Both women and men can develop benign (noncancerous) breast lumps.

                        <p>
                            In Situ is short for In Situ Carcinoma.
                            In Situ Carcinoma is a group of abnormal cells that are found only in the place where they first
                            formed in the body.
                            These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread to nearby normal tissue.
                            In general, carcinoma in situ is the earliest form of cancer, and is considered stage 0 cancer
                            that
                            has not yet spread.

                        <p>
                            Invasive is short for Invasive Carcinoma.
                            Invasive Carcinoma cells are cancerous and this means that these abnormal cells growing in the
                            lining of the milk ducts
                            have changed and invaded breast tissue beyond the walls of the duct.

                            This means that your breast cells are normal and healthy, as there were no abnormal cells
                            detected!
